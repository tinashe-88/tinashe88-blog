For many people, including myself I assumed that learning a programming 
language was an audacious task left to those with IQ over whatever the 
genius number is in "IQ" terms.

I honestly thought that I had to be on par with the likes of Jobs, Hawkins,
Musk, etc., with regards to intelligence. Point is, you must be "this" smart 
to learn how to program.

### What is Javascript

Let me introduce you to Javascript. Now before I dive in, there are 2 
elements you should be familiar with,
[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) 
and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). 
I highly recommend you check them out before continuing unless 
you're confident enough to go forward then be my guest.

Javascript is a lightweight programming language, interpreted, object-oriented 
with first-class functions (think of them as first-class passengers, 
access to certain "privileges"). For now, focus on the lightweight part. 
This language is, to me, a gateway into programming as a whole
because the language was inspired by the more robust programming languages 
such as C++, Java, Python etc.

### Javascript and the Web

Are you still not convinced? Ok, it's the language of the 
web! Chances are, you have probably been on a Javascript enabled site or you 
still live in the early '90s. To be precise, it is the best known powerful 
scripting language of the web that can also be implemented in non-browser 
environments and one of the core technologies of the web.

A majority of websites use it for client-side page behaviour and all major 
web browsers such as Goggle Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc., have a dedicated 
Javascript engine to execute it.

A javascript engine, by the way, is just a computer program that runs 
javascript code. The first Javascript engines were mere interpreters but 
all relevant modern engines utilize just in time compilation for improved 
performance. Engines were originally used only in web browsers but they 
are now embedded in some servers - usually via NodeJs.

Javascript enables interactive web pages
and is an essential part of web applications alongside HTML and CSS.

### Not what you think

It is often confused with Java, however, the basic syntax was inspired by Java 
and the other "heavier" languages to reduce the number of new concepts required 
to learn the language. JavaScript and Java are somewhat similar in some ways but 
fundamentally distinct in some other ways.

```js
function helloJavascript() {
  console.log("This is Javascript!")
}
```

JS is also a multi-paradigm language that supports event-driven, functional 
and imperative programming styles. What does that mean in a nutshell? It means 
if you have a prefered programming style you can apply it to Javascript.

It can function as both a procedural and an object-oriented language. Objects 
are created both programmatically in javascript by attaching methods and 
properties to otherwise empty objects at run-time, unlike the syntactic class 
definitions found in compiled languages. Once an object has been constructed, 
it can be used as a blueprint (prototype) for creating similar objects.

The language contains a standard library of objects, such as __Number__,
__String__, __Math__ and so on.

### Some core elements

It has a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, 
and statements. CoreJS can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
supplementing it with additional objects. 

For example:

- __Client-side__ javascript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its' Document Object Model (DOM). Eg., client-side extensions allow an app to place elements on an HTML form an respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input and page navigation.
- __Server-side__ javascript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JS on the server. As a quick example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of info from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on the server.

### So what can it do

I'm not going to list all the possibilities Javascript offers, but I will 
leave but a taste of what it can do. 

-  Display timely content (Chat, news, social media...)
-  Animate using 2D/3D
-  Audio Apps
-  Charts to display important data
-  Games
-  etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...

Javascript has a say in what makes a webpage come to life. Wherever your 
mind takes you, Javascript can probably take you there.

### Why Javascript

JavaScript is probably the most open programming language there is with 
an exorbitant amount of resources, you can fetch online. Books, podcasts, 
blog posts, email newsletters, video tutorials, and more are readily available.

With ECMA-262 as its' specification, it is closely followed by many 
implementations from independent parties. Some of these implementations
are of course open source. TC39 - Furthermore, a group of JavaScript 
developers, implementers, academics, and more, called the 
TC39 handle the evolution of the language collaborating with the 
community to safe-guard and evolve the definition of JavaScript, a 
committee consisting of several companies, including all major 
browser vendors.A majority of those companies under normal circumstances 
are competitors, but they work together for the benefit of the language.

### Javascript and beyond...

It's widely used, I mean think about how many people are on the web as
you're reading excluding yourself. Go on, think about it - I'll wait.
Now that you've probably come up with a number with a considerable 
amount of zeros, you can probably see how in demand this language is.

The future looks very bright because the language continues to evolve and
as the web begins to mature Javascript will have an integral part in how
the web is viewed. It's an attractive, simplistic language that's not perfect
but, things can only get better from here.

And a special shoutout to
